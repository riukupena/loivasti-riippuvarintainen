# W.I.P
# Phase 1: Goals & Planning
## Why a Homelab?

- Personal interests and curiosity
- Learning and skill development
- Testing new technologies
- Home automation and media
- Tired of trying to keep up with all the different streaming platforms
- Data privacy


## Initial Goals

- I want to create "netflix and icloud/m365/google replacement" for me and my family and i get to tinker with my "e-waste" ive been collecting
- I want to further develop my skills in IT, especially docker, vm etc.
- Realistically I want to atleast get a working NAS, PVE and have a docker mediaserver running which plays the media from NAS storage.


## Planning Steps

- Assess current knowledge
- Research homelab setups
- Create a budget and timeline
- Decide on documentation tools (Markdown, GitHub, diagrams)
